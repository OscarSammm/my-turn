          I’m Toro — a student-athlete and coach. This page is my full soccer
          story: where I’ve played, what I’ve earned, how I train, and why my
          standard is different.

          <h2>Quick Snapshot</h2>
          <p>
            I play with purpose. I’m the type of player who wants the ball in
            difficult moments, and I work every day to be ready when that moment
            comes.

        <!-- JOURNEY -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="journey">
          <h2>Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Soccer has been the one thing I never stopped building. The journey
            isn’t just about goals or highlights — it’s about the mindset I
            developed: show up, work, learn, repeat.
          </p>

          <p>
            I came from Honduras with big goals and I knew I had to earn
            everything. I learned fast that talent gets you noticed, but habits
            keep you there. So I built habits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every season I focused on one thing: becoming more complete. Not
            only scoring, but also defending, pressing, communicating, and
            making teammates better.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHERE I’VE PLAYED -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="played">
          <h2>Where I’ve Played</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve competed across multiple levels, and each level forced me to
            grow. Different coaches, different teammates, different systems —
            I learned how to adapt while keeping my identity.
          </p>

          <ul class="articleList">
            <li>
              <strong>Cypress Creek High School</strong> — District Champions (Senior Year),
              scored <strong>22 goals</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paris Junior College</strong> — Freshman/Sophomore,
              <strong>18 goals</strong> + <strong>13 assists</strong>,
              <strong>Second Team All-Region</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>UT Tyler</strong> — Sophomore/Junior</li>
            <li><strong>TAMUSA</strong> — Current</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I’ve played both wide and central. I can attack from the wing with
            pace and 1v1 skill, or create in the middle as a CAM with timing,
            vision, and quick decision-making.

        <!-- RECOGNITIONS + WINS -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="recognitions">
          <h2>Personal Recognitions & Wins</h2>
          <p>
            I’m proud of the results, but I’m more proud of the consistency
            behind them. These are outcomes of discipline — not luck.
          </p>

          <ul class="articleList">
            <li><strong>District Champion</strong> (High School)</li>
            <li><strong>22 goals</strong> (Senior Year)</li>
            <li><strong>18 goals</strong> + <strong>13 assists</strong> (Paris Junior College)</li>

            <li><strong>Region All-Team</strong> / <strong>Conference All-Team</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For me, recognition is a reminder: keep the same hunger, even when
            things are going well.

        <!-- PLAYING IDENTITY -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="identity">
          <h2>My Playing Identity</h2>
          <p>
            I play fast and fearless, but controlled. My goal is to create
            danger — either by beating my man, combining quickly, or arriving at
            the right time in the box.
          </p>

          <h3>What I bring on the field</h3>
          <ul class="articleList">
            <li><strong>1v1 threat:</strong> I attack space, force mistakes, and commit defenders</li>
            <li><strong>End product:</strong> I look for the final pass or finish with confidence</li>
            <li><strong>Work rate:</strong> I press, track back, and do the dirty work</li>
            <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> I keep it simple when it’s needed</li>
            <li><strong>Mentality:</strong> I don’t disappear when the game gets hard</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What I’m always improving</h3>
          <ul class="articleList">
            <li>Faster scanning and earlier decisions</li>
            <li>Finishing under pressure and from different angles</li>
            <li>More control of tempo (when to slow down vs. speed up)</li>

        <!-- WHY I’M DIFFERENT -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="different">
          <h2>Why I Know I’m Different</h2>
          <p>
            My confidence comes from work. I don’t rely on motivation — I rely
            on routine. When I say I’m different, I mean I’m consistent.
          </p>

          <p>
            I train when I’m tired. I review my mistakes. I ask questions. I
            stay disciplined with recovery and sleep. I show up ready, because
            I respect the game.
          </p>

          <ul class="articleList">
            <li><strong>Same standard every day:</strong> practice, gym, film, recovery</li>
            <li><strong>Coachability:</strong> I want feedback, even if it’s hard</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> I bring energy and accountability</li>
            <li><strong>Big-moment mindset:</strong> pressure makes me focus more, not less</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- TRAINING -->
        <section class="articleSection" id="training">
          <h2>How I Train</h2>
          <p>
            I don’t train randomly. I train with intention. I build the athlete
            first, then sharpen the soccer tools on top of that.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical work</h3>
          <ul class="articleList">
            <li>Ball mastery + first touch (both feet)</li>

        <section class="articleSection" id="coaching">
          <h2>How I Coach (1-on-1)</h2>
          <p>
            When I coach, I keep it simple: I fix one thing at a time and build
            confidence through reps. The goal is performance — not just a hard
            workout.
          </p>

          <h3>What sessions usually include</h3>
          <ul class="articleList">

            <li>Game-speed drills (1v1, finishing, decision-making)</li>
            <li>Short conditioning finisher</li>
            <li>Quick feedback + next focus</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you’re serious, I’ll push you — but I’ll also teach you how to
            train the right way so you can improve faster.
